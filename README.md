## Design a backend system for FlipFit to partner with gyms
- There are currently two centers, Koramangala and Bellandur. We should be able to expand
- Each center has n slots for an hour each
- Each slots can have n possible workouts
- No of seats for a workout for a time slot for a center is fixed
- User can perform the following:
    - register on the platform
    - view workouts availability/unavailability for a day
    - book a workout for an user if seats are available for the timeslot in that center
- Return the earliest timeslot for same workout/center/user combination
